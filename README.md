# www_kirkg_us

Nothing very special here. This is the framework for my site -- built on [Nikola](http://www.getnikola.com).

If you want to build my site, for whatever reason, then you will need python 3, with pip. Then:

  * clone the git repo
  * `cd www_kirkg_us`
  * `pyvenv .`
  * `source bin/activate`
  * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  With that you should be set up and ready to go. Just follow the steps on the [Nikola site](http://www.getnikola.com) to get started.
