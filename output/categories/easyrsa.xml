In theory these instructions could be followed on any old &lt;a href="https://www.freebsd.org"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt; 11 jail, but FreeNAS provides a friendly UI, so why not use it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For giggles, I'm taking screenshots for this with the new FreeNAS UI. So far it's nice. You should definitely try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update the Jail config&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I had to do was to fix the jails config. I did this by going to Jails -&amp;gt; Configuration (in the left hand nav menu). Under advanced mode, there is an option for "Collection URL". The value that was in there by default (http://download.freenas.org/latest/RELEASE/x64/jails) didn't work for me, but I managed to figure out that it should probably be something more like this one &lt;a href="http://download.freenas.org/jails/11/x64/"&gt;http://download.freenas.org/jails/11/x64/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Much to my surprise, this article seems to have gotten some traction, so I'm posting an update to it (leaving the old one in place for posterity's sake).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I wrote the previous article, a few things have changed. The most important change that the diligent reader will need to be aware of is that I've upgraded my &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2F1TmlP"&gt;FreeNAS&lt;/a&gt; from the 9.3 train to the 9.10 train. The UI looks the same, but there is the added benefit of being able to use FreeBSD 10 as the jail template.&lt;/p&gt;
