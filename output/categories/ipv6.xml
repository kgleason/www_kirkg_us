I had two different tunnels, and all of my home network had v6 IP addresses -- all statically assigned, with working reverse DNS. Even the Windows XP machines. Then I got lazy. I swapped out my hand-crafted &lt;a href="https://openbsd.org"&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; router for an off-the-shelf wireless router. That old homemade router was old enough that I couldn't put a Wifi card in it, and I just wanted some wifi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a couple of years now, I've noticed that Comcast has been giving me an IPv6 address, but I haven't really been able to figure anything out with it. When I was using an Apple AirPort Extreme,  turning on IPv6 would break everything. So I just left it off. Even when I was running &lt;a href="https://pfsense.org"&gt;pfSense&lt;/a&gt;, I saw it, but I spent so much time accidentally breaking &lt;a href="https://pfsense.org"&gt;pfSense&lt;/a&gt; that I never got to look into it any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm a few months into &lt;a href="https://opnsense.org"&gt;OPNSense&lt;/a&gt; now, and things seem to be rock solid, I decided to have another go at IPv6. What follows are the steps that I took to get IPv6 up and running as expected on my home network.&lt;/p&gt;
