A jail is a way to run a process or set of processes in an environment that is
isolated from the host system. Processes created inside a jail cannot access files
outside of that jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a host of reasons why you might want to run your services in jails, but
the primary reason is that it allows you to run disparate services without having
to worry about a flaw in one service allowing access to another service. For example,
jails will allow you to run a mail server and a web server on the same Droplet
without having to be overly concerned that a vulnerability in your web site could
expose the data in your mail server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this article, you will take a newly minted FreeBSD Droplet, do
some initial configuration, set up a jail, and install a simple web server
inside the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, you will be setting up a firewall to protect the host system. This
tutorial will be using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/firewalls-pf.html"&gt;PF&lt;/a&gt; firewall that is included in FreeBSD. Aside from
configuring a firewall, you will also be making some tweaks to the default shell
as well as making some changes to the configuration of some of the default services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Build the server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, for giggles, I decided to see if I could convert a virtual private server (VPS) into a desktop and access it remotely. Seems to have worked, so I've decided to do it again, in case anyone else ever wanted to. At the end of this, you'll have a server at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=18b80ab28634"&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; running &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ubuntu-mate.org"&gt;Ubuntu MATE&lt;/a&gt; that you can access from almost any platform with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.x2go.org"&gt;X2Go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start out by going to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=18b80ab28634"&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and spinning up a new droplet. I chose Ubuntu 14.04 x64, but it shouldn't bee too much work to get this working with Ubuntu 14.10. Wait your requisite 57 seconds (mine only took 44 seconds!!), and connect to the machine. While completely optional, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=18b80ab28634"&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; has some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04"&gt;great recommendations&lt;/a&gt; with what to do &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/additional-recommended-steps-for-new-ubuntu-14-04-servers"&gt;after you build your droplet&lt;/a&gt;. At the very least, configure yourself a firewall, leaving port 22 (or whatever port you choose) open. Our remote desktop will only need SSH to connect. It's probably also a good idea to run some updates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 3 kids. And a wife. We lead pretty hectic lives, and there doesn't seem
to be an end in sight to the insanity. Given all of that, it seems as if we
always have a list of stuff that we need from the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than once, I've been at the grocery store fulfilling the needs on the
pre-written list only to be bombarded with text messages asking for this and that.
Sometimes I get lucky and manage to get everything on the lists (the written
lists and all of the impromptu SMS lists). More often than not I end up overlooking
something because it isn't all in one place. Quite frankly it doesn't help that
I'm easily distracted in the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://xamarin.com/ios"&gt;Xamarin.iOS&lt;/a&gt; project. While the tests are still under development, I decided to
make a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jenkins-ci.org/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; job to fire off the the UI tests whenever a change was detected
on the branch where the tests were being developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a little more than I was expecting to getting it running, so it is
going to become the 2nd article in my impromptu series about Jenkins and Xamarin.&lt;/p&gt;

in a continuous integration set up. Bravo. I read through with rapt anticipation,
only to be let down. Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kirkg.us/2013/04/09/continuous-integration-with-monotouch-and-jenkins/"&gt;an other blog post&lt;/a&gt; about being an Apple Enterprise developer and
the particular challenges that ensue therefrom. In a nutshell, when you are an
enterprise developer developing apps for other people, you have to work closely
with your clients to get the provisioning working correctly. Then the hard part
starts: you need to figure out how to make it all work in Xamarin Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

None
of us had any mobile experience to speak of, so we read some books. As we began
debugging early versions of the app, we learned pretty quickly that we needed a
standardized build process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time we knew of solutions like Jenkins, but didn't really know where to
begin. Since the developers were pretty swamped with development and debugging,
I took on the responsibility of trying to standardize the build process. I'm not
really a programmer, and I didn't really know how solution and project files work.
Since we were working in MonoDevelop rather than in Visual Studio, none of the
devs really had time or capacity to stop and take a look at the options that
were there.&lt;/p&gt;
