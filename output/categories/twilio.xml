&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 3 kids. And a wife. We lead pretty hectic lives, and there doesn't seem
to be an end in sight to the insanity. Given all of that, it seems as if we
always have a list of stuff that we need from the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than once, I've been at the grocery store fulfilling the needs on the
pre-written list only to be bombarded with text messages asking for this and that.
Sometimes I get lucky and manage to get everything on the lists (the written
lists and all of the impromptu SMS lists). More often than not I end up overlooking
something because it isn't all in one place. Quite frankly it doesn't help that
I'm easily distracted in the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
