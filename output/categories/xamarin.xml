&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://xamarin.com/ios"&gt;Xamarin.iOS&lt;/a&gt; project. While the tests are still under development, I decided to
make a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jenkins-ci.org/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; job to fire off the the UI tests whenever a change was detected
on the branch where the tests were being developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a little more than I was expecting to getting it running, so it is
going to become the 2nd article in my impromptu series about Jenkins and Xamarin.&lt;/p&gt;

in a continuous integration set up. Bravo. I read through with rapt anticipation,
only to be let down. Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kirkg.us/2013/04/09/continuous-integration-with-monotouch-and-jenkins/"&gt;an other blog post&lt;/a&gt; about being an Apple Enterprise developer and
the particular challenges that ensue therefrom. In a nutshell, when you are an
enterprise developer developing apps for other people, you have to work closely
with your clients to get the provisioning working correctly. Then the hard part
starts: you need to figure out how to make it all work in Xamarin Studio.&lt;/p&gt;

None
of us had any mobile experience to speak of, so we read some books. As we began
debugging early versions of the app, we learned pretty quickly that we needed a
standardized build process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time we knew of solutions like Jenkins, but didn't really know where to
begin. Since the developers were pretty swamped with development and debugging,
I took on the responsibility of trying to standardize the build process. I'm not
really a programmer, and I didn't really know how solution and project files work.
Since we were working in MonoDevelop rather than in Visual Studio, none of the
devs really had time or capacity to stop and take a look at the options that
were there.&lt;/p&gt;
