    <p>I've never liked shaving. In fact, it seems as if I've hated it for most of my adult life. It could be inaccurate, but I remember being very nonchalant about getting a razor for Christmas from a friend -- I think I was 14 or 15. It also seems like it was quite a while before I used it.</p>
<p>I remember looking around at people when I was in college and starting work who were constantly clean shaven. Sometimes I wondered what my problem was. I suspect that it had to do with the fact that I had a girl friend -- even though I'm certain that she would have preferred that I had been clean shaven.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>Well in any case, recently I've been trying to clean up a bit and I decided I needed to get over this shaving thing, but I wasn't very optimistic. How much I've learned in the past couple of months.</p>
<p>I've spent some time over the past couple of weeks going over why I disliked shaving, and I've come up with a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like to sleep in the morning. I'd much rather work till 1 or 2am and get out of bed after 9am. Just how I've always been. Since I have a job where I need to be in before 9 pretty consistently, shaving before work meant that I needed to get up and at it 10 minutes before I really wanted to.</li>
<li>It costs too much. Up until very recently I have used a Gillette Sensor II that I bought in my early 20's. I thought about upgrading every time a new razor came out with 3, 4, 5, 6 blades. In the end I was consistently turned off by the price of buying a new handle and the price of the replacement cartridges. Even with that old Sensor II, I still would complain about the cartridges. Even with as rarely as I shaved, it seemed as if I was spending too much money on razors.</li>
<li>It dried my face out. I don't know if it was the shaving gel / lotion or the after shave, but my face always felt brittle afterwards. Mind you I used to use shaving gel &amp; aftershave off the shelf from the local megastore.</li>
<li>It always felt like a chore. A waste of time. Time that I could be doing something better.</li>
</ul>
<p>So here's the interesting part. Over the course of a couple of months,a few random things about shaving came through my twitter feed. I don't follow any shaving geeks on twitter. Everything that came up was talking about the pleasure of kind of kicking it old school, regarding shaving. Seemed like an odd coincidence.</p>
<p>Thinking back over my list, there's obviously nothing I can do about the first one (aside from shaving in the evening, which I don't want to do). But the rest might be able to dealt with.</p>
<p>I started out with changing the aftershave. I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N9MJX8/ref=wms_ohs_product">this stuff</a> on Amazon that got some pretty good review. It's alcohol free, and pretty nice. I was impressed. So far so good with what all the random articles that I had seen on twitter.</p>
<p>Next thing to replace the shaving gel. I took to amazon again, and found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L2U61E/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&amp;redirect=true.%20Or%20course,%20I%20couldn't%20use%20this%20without%20a%20[shaving%20brush](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G647Y8/ref=wms_ohs_product.%20I%20opted%20not%20to%20buy%20a%20bowl%20for%20mixing%20the%20soap,%20and%20decided%20to%20start%20out%20using%20an%20old%20coffee%20cup.%20Now%20I%20liked%20that%20shaving%20soap%20--%20it%20is%20tingly%20on%20my%20face,%20and%20did%20a%20great%20job%20at%20making%20the%20hairs%20stand%20up.%20The%20downside%20was%20that%20I%20went%20through%20almost%20the%20entire%20tube%20before%20I%20figured%20out%20how%20to%20mix%20it%20well.%20I%20went%20through%20that%20tube%20in%20about%206%20weeks,%20which%20is%20kinda%20pricey%20when%20you%20do%20the%20math%20annually.%20Now%20that%20I've%20gotten%20the%20hang%20of%20it,%20I%20think%20I%20can%20make%20a%20tube%20last%20closer%20to%204%20or%205%20month">some stuff in a tube</a>.</p>
<p>The crazy thing was that I was spending more time shaving (since I had to ship that soap into a lather, and then spread it on my face), but it was kind of enjoyable -- partly because it was a challenge, and partly because my skin isn't dry anymore after I get done. Between the aftershave lotion, and the shaving soap, things felt a lot better. It  also seemed like the razor cartridges were lasting longer.</p>
<p>But I decided to change the razor out as well. Amazon to the rescue again, with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FC7B2G/ref=wms_ohs_product">safety razor</a> that uses ... wait for it ... a double edged razor blade. Now the razor handle itself was pretty pricey, but looking at the price of double edged blades and how long they seem to be lasting, I think that I'll be able to use maybe 12 blades a year. 15 is probably more likely, but it won't be higher than that. Given the fact that you can pick up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Superior-Premium-Platinum-Double-Safety/dp/B001QY8QXM/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346122473&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=double+edge+razor+blades">double edges razor blades in bulk for around $.09 apiece</a> I'm thinking that I'll start seeing some savings at some point next year.</p>
<p>Now I'll admit that I was a little nervous about using the old school razor. I figured that there had to be a reason that people switched away from this type of razor years ago. I was expecting that I would cut myself like crazy the first time I tried. I figured that I would end up with razor burn all over my face. I figured that I wouldn't get a great shave.</p>
<p>Wrong on every single count. I've ended up with fewer nicks nicks in the last 2 months than in the previous 2 months. The razor seems to just float over my skin, so razor burn hasn't been problematic.</p>
<p>As far as the quality of the shave ... it is pretty much the same over a day to day basis. But the real test is shaving after taking a couple of days off. Well last week was a lulu at work, and I only shaved on Monday. Getting up on Sunday for church, I wasn't entirely sure what I was in for. I had some pretty significantly growth after 5 days of not shaving. I lathered up, and tore into it. I was blown away in that I didn't have to do anything different than I had on Monday. I didn't have to use shorter strokes, nor did I have to push harder. It just worked. Amazing.</p>
<p>In the midst of all of this, I did purchase a different type of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L6X522/ref=wms_ohs_product">shaving soap</a>. I like it alright. It is smoother than the Proraso stuff in the tube, but it doesn't seem to stand the hair up quite a well. I think that in the end I'll end up keeping 2 different types of shaving soap about about. One for day to day, and one for days after I've been lazy.</p>
<p>So there you have it. I've made the change, and I won't be going back. I think this is how I;ll be teaching the boys how to shave even. The best part, and this is something that I hadn't previously thought about, is how much greener this is. So far I've thrown away an empty foil tube (think old school toothpaste), and a thin piece of metal (in the form of a double egde razor blade). The soap &amp; the aftershave are all natural ingredients, so fewer chemicals being washed down the drain.</p>
<p>If anyone is looking for an almost antique Gillette Sensor II, let me know. It'll be first come first serve. I'd be willing to trade it for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Colonel-Conk-Evernice-775-Chrome/dp/B001XURHNY/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=1JWX4LFQ4TO84&amp;coliid=I13NNAXYDP4HTQ">razor / brush stand</a>.</p>
