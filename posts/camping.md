So we are in the midst of planning a camping trip with some friends. Sydney and I have been working on a list of stuff to take camping. (It should count towards a badge that Sydney is working on for Girl Scouts). Given how it's always interesting watching how these lists can grow over time and the we also needed a quick way to share this list with the friends with whom we are planning on camping; I thought I would post the list up here, and people can use the comments section to make additions / suggestions as necessary.

The list is somewhat stream of consciousness, but here we go:
