This blog is a testament to the fact that I don't always commit to things as well as I should. I really want to write more, but I always seem to find something better to do. Hopefully this article will motivate me to be better about keeping the content here a bit fresher. Today I'm going to outline what I learned about commitment during the last 22 months as I've lost a bunch of weight.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

I remember pretty clearly a January morning in 2015 -- I think it was January 2nd 2015, but I could be off by a day or 2. What I know is what the scale said. I remember very clearly the groan that I made, likely the sound that the scale wanted to make as I stood there on it. 337. It couldn't be possible could it? Three. Hundred. Thirty. Seven. Pounds. Ugh.

(Aside: for any of my overseas friends who may be reading this, I'll do my best to outline all of these measurements in other systems as well. So in this case 337 pounds is approximately 153 kilograms, or 24 stone)

To top it all off, most of my pants didn't fit, and the ones that still did were starting to get pretty snug -- and they were 44 in waists (111 centimeters). I decided it was time for a change. Given that it was the beginning of the, it would seem like a perfect resolution, right? Well I didn't do that. Mostly because I did want to be that guy. I didn't announce anything, or do anything terribly different. Early on (for several months in fact), the only change that I made was to eat fewer carbs. I managed to cut back on pasta, bread, beer, and bourbon pretty substantially over the course of the next few months. Otherwise nothing else changed too much. When I would go home for lunch, rather than making 2 sandwiches, I would make one -- with double to meat & cheese. Stuff like that.

I wasn't getting on the scale regularly, but I began to notice that the size 44 pants were getting to big, and the 42s were quite comfortable again. Yippee. I remember getting on the scale one day and being very happy that I had dropped below 300 lbs (21 stone, 136 kg). I didn't make note of that date (I wish that I had), but I'd have to guess that it was probably in May of 2015. In more or less 6 months, I had managed to lose around 40 lbs (18 kg, 2.8 stone) just by eating less. I wasn't exercising at all.

The next big date in this adventure was Aug 9, 2015. I remember that date specifically because it is my wedding anniversary. My wife decided that we needed FitBits, and bought them as our anniversary present to each other. I'll admit that I was skeptical, I didn't think it would make a difference. Boy was I wrong. On that date, I entered my weight into the FitBit app as 287.5 lbs (20.7 stone, 103.4 kg).

The thing that the FitBit helped me to notice right away was how sedentary my life was. My wife, who works in a pre-school, spends all day moving. I'd get alerts from the thing telling me that she had hit this goal of some other. She was consistently coming home with over 10,000 steps. I was consistently coming home with under 2000. That's 8 - 10 hours of work, plus at least an hour of puttering around in the morning, and fewer than 2000 steps. I decided it was time to step up my game, and I started walking. After all, the evidence seemed to be pretty overwhelming. A little bit of movement could go a long way.

It sucked at first. My knees were sore, my feet hurt, and I didn't want to do it. I remember thinking to myself on a couple of different occasions that I didn't need to do this. After all, I had lost 50 lbs (22.6 kg, 3.6 stone) without going through any of this. I had started tracking my food intake (again, with the FitBit app), and I could probably keep going on just fine with just controlling my caloric intake.

But, I wondered, what would happen if I really applied myself? What could I really accomplish?

And that is what kept me walking. September 5 2015 was the fist day when I hit 15,000 steps in a single day, and the week of September 14 - 20 was the first week when I averaged over 10,000 steps per day. Over the course of the next few months, I managed to lose a lot of weight. More than I figured I'd be able to. On Nov 18, 2016 I weighed in at 264.6 lbs (18.9 stone, 120 kg). That's a loss of 20 lbs since the day I got the FitBit, just 9 week earlier -- averaging a hair over 2 lbs / week.

However, I can't claim that it was just walking that made the difference. I did make additional adjustments to my diet. In October, I scrapped the FitBit app for food tracking, and switched over to MyFitnessPal. The quality of the data from MFP was vastly superior, which resulted in more accurate tracking. I was also using the weight loss goals feature of MyFitnessPal to help set food goals for each day -- essentially how many calories I was going to consume. I dropped back to about 2,200 calories per day.

I also watched "That Sugar Film", and started actively cutting sugar from my diet. (Another aside, you should watch that movie. Especially if you are American. Sugar is probably killing you, and no one in this country is talking about it.)

In order to keep myself feeling full, I also started focusing on the amount of fiber in my diet. More fruit, more veg, and more oats. Those were the easiest ways to eat more fiber that tasted good.

So between the walking, and the dietary changes, I averaged 2 lbs of loss per week for a pretty good period of time. I rarely felt hungry, and I almost never did anything more than walking about 3 miles in one stretch. I even managed to lose weight through the week of Thanksgiving. I'm living proof that it is possible.

Going into December, I was right around 260 lbs (118 kg, 18.5 stone), and I distinctly remember feeling good. Better than I could remember feeling for many many years. At this point, it seemed as if losing 100 lbs was a reasonable goal. I had already lost 77 lbs (5.5 stone, 35 kg) so far in 2015. I knew that I wouldn't get it by the end of 2015, but who cares? I only had 23 more lbs to go (10.5 kg, 1.6 stone). So that became the next goal. To lose 100 lbs (7 stone, 45 kg). So i kept going. On Dec 18, 2016, I was exactly 250 lbs. Awesome.

For Christmas in 2015, we went on a cruise, and spent some time at Disney World. I made the conscious decision to not track while we were on vacation. I didn't have a scale, I didn't have Internet access for a good portion of the vacation (by design), so I let this go as well. During that cruise I realized 2 things. First, I couldn't eat as much as I used to. Second, after not eating sugar for so long, dessert tended to be very very sweet.

I ate a lot of seafood on that cruise, and during the entire vacation; and we were quite active during the entire thing. So not only was it an awesome vacation, but I came back a mere 6 lbs heavier than when I left (255.8 lbs, 116 kg, 18.2 stone). Not bad for what felt like 10 days of decadence. I got right back on the horse when we got back though.

On February 15, 2016 I weighed in at 234 lbs. I had officially crossed the 100 lb loss mark, and it took me right around 16 months -- averaging 6.5 lbs per month. I set my final goal at 225 lbs. It seemed like a good healthy number. It didn't take terribly long to get there (march 21, 2016). Goal hit, it was time to focus on maintaining. Right?

No quite so easy. By this point, I had quite the routine. Three of the five meals I eat on an average day are pretty set in stone: breakfast is a goat cheese breakfast sandwich and a cup of coffee (clocking in around 300 calories); morning snack is a banana or some other piece of fruit, and a serving of refrigerator oatmeal (somewhere around 340 calories); and afternoon snack is generally a fiber one bar and another piece of fruit or two (generally around 250 - 300 calories). While the lunch menu varies from day to day, it was generally between 550 and 600 calories, and dinner was generally around 600 calories. It was more difficult that I would have imagined to add in an extra 200 - 300 calories per day, so I kept losing weight.

During this time, I'd get lots of eye rolls from people. This was the time when I suddenly weighed less than many of my friends; and they'd ask me how far I was planning on going. I'd explain that I was trying to get to a steady point, but couldn't seem to add the extra calories back in. I did desperately want to stop losing weight, because I knew at this point that I was losing muscle. I didn't have definitive way to prove it; but the popping that started in my shoulder, and the somewhat chronic pain I was feeling in my shoulders were my evidence.

I eventually went as low as 205 lbs, and have gotten back up to around 215 (95 kg, 15.3 stone), and I've been able to maintain that for several months.

Someday soon I'm going to follow this up with a more in-depth article about the tools that I used, how I used them, and why I think I managed to get this done with relatively little consternation.
