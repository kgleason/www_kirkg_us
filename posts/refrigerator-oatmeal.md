Heard about refrigerator oatmeal recently from an friend, and it sounded interesting. I looked around a bit on the interwebs and found a few recipes for it. But the ones that I was the most interested in also seemed like a bit of a pain to mix up. I saw a lot of recipes that seemed to be working in lots of small containers. As with most recipes, I took it and played with it a bit. Here is what I ended up with:

<!--TEASER_END -->

  * 3 cups of Quaker rolled oats. (Stay away from the cheap stuff. Get a good quality rolled oat. And none of that instant or fast cooking stuff.)
  * 2 ½ cups of buttermilk.  (You can use regular milk if this is too tangy for you)
  * Around 8 oz of natural raspberry preserves. Honestly, I buy a 17.5 oz jar of Smuckers natural, and put half of it in.
  * A 24 oz container of plain (unflavored) non-fat greek yogurt
  * 2 Tbs of vanilla extract
  * 6 Tbs of chia seed.

Dump everything into a bowl and mix it all together with a spoon. I use a wooden spoon cause it feels old school. Then take this and split it up into serving size portions. I dole it out into 1/2 pint freezer jars that I grabbed in the canning section of the grocery store -- 9 of them to be exact. I end up with a little room left at the top. If I happen to be making up a batch on the same day as my grocery store run, then I'll grab fresh raspberries and put 4 or 5 of them on top before I put them in the fridge. But since the fresh raspberries don't last in my house, I've also been keeping frozen ones in the freezer, and I throw a handful of them on top of a mid week batch.

After everything is lidded up, stick em in the fridge, and let it set overnight. In the morning grab one and enjoy. Cold. I guess you could try warming it up, but we haven't. It's yummy cold. We had one container make it to 5 days in the fridge, and perfectly edible still. Generally with 3 of us eating them, they are all gone within 4 days. I suspect that they may be getting eaten as after school snacks as well.

For anyone who is interested, they look to be about 7 Weight Watchers+ points, or probably around 300 calories a pop. I can eat one and make it through the morning.

If you are not sure about the chia seed, you can definitely make it without, but it will be runnier -- the chia seeds help soak up some of the liquid and get soft to the point where you don't notice them after they have soaked overnight. I suspect that it will be a bit less satisfying without them, since they add to the bulk. Plus those things are little nutritional powerhouses. Look it up.
