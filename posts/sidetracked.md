So as we write all these posts about our vacation, I feel like I should start an "Anthony's best quotes" page for all the crazy things my sweet child has come up with this week.  I hate to clutter the vacation stuff with them or have someone miss one so...  here I am to tell you a few good ones...

We started playing the license plate game on the way -- At one point early in the week Anthony says, "Why are there so many stinking Virginia plates everywhere we already got Virginia?"  -- sorry dear our hotel is in Virginia... DUH!

Today's quote:  "The metro is really fast except when it slows down"  Uh... wasn't sure what to even say to that!

Zoo = animal hotel thingy

I'll add to this as I think of more of them... he is a riot some days!
