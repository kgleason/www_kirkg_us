Today we spent a lot of time with our wonderful family.  The kids swam and played together. I think this was the first time ALL the kids have interacted and had a good time together...   Anthony used his baby whispering skills on baby Lewis who was cranky and didn't want to be held or sleep.  Curled in his arms Lewis was content and went to sleep! It was very cute.

Once we left it was a pretty boring day... driving to DC, saw a few sights from the car, and then went to the hotel to settle in and get some groceries for dinners ...
