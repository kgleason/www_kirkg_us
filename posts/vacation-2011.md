So we are off on an adventure. We left Friday morning and picked up Sydney and Anthony from church camp and headed out. Ultimate destination: Washington DC.  First stop: Gettysburg.  We got in late last night- the curvy roads to get here after the PA turnpike SUCK!  Waiting on the children this morning to eat their breakfast so we can head to the battlefield. Anthony can't wait to see where Lincoln did his big speech! And the battlefield... Think he is gonna be disappointed when the battlefield looks like a big grassy field!  But my little history buff can't wait!  - hopefully the next entry will be from one of the children. Til then....  Jen :)
