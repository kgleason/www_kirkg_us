##Type of Run##
Interval / Distance: 2x 2.7 miles; .3 miles recovery

##Miles##
5.6

##Time & Pace##
59:01
10:27 / min

##Route##
[In the neighboorhood](http://rndb.co/j8Zp)

##Terrain##
Moderately hilly

##How I felt##
Good. Right calf was a little crampy, but no cramp ever developed.

##Effort##
Not too bad. Never really felt like I hit a wall.
Heart was 50 minutes of Peak (according to FitBit), which is over 152 bpm.

##Notes##
Nice sunny day. About 25 degrees when I left. Wore Nike tights, and running shorts, long sleeved drifit T, with a cotton T over top. Mittens. No hat. Was just about perfect.

Didn't plan the route out very well. In order to avoid the big downhill by the Rogers & High roundabout, I ended up going back through the Stands, which meant that I finished the run well over a mile from home.
