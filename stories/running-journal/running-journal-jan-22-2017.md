##Terrain##
Decent amount of hills. Fitbit measure something like 30 flights of stairs.

##How I felt##
Felt OK.

##Effort##
It was hard. Really hit a wall again between 2.5 mile and 3 miles (also happens to be a big hill at that point this time). Pace dropped way off at that point.

##Notes##
Gorgeous outside. 60 degrees. No tights or anything. Started to feel a cramp at one point, but it went away. Also ran in the afternoon, after eating too much pizza for lunch.

Had a blister on my left foot from the previous run. Didn't feel it (had a bandage on it), but I did feel it afterwards.

##Other Stuff (Optional)##
Weight:

Diet: Ate a small piece of chicken the previous night. May have upset my stomach. Ate 1/2 large pizza for lunch as well.

Training For:
Conditioning / adding distance

Shoes:
Blue & yellow Brooke's. 19 miles so far.
