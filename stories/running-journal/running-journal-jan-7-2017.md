http://www.rundouble.com/run/5404146679152640/ZsoHdL4uzW

##Terrain##
A few hills. Mostly pretty flat.

##Temperature##
18 degress.

##How I felt##
Pretty good. Ran out of breath around 2.6 miles. Had to stop and walk for a few meters. Kind of cold.

##Effort##
It didn't feel too bad, but Fitbit had a pretty high heartrate through most of the run: 23 peak minutes, 7 cardio.

##Notes##
There was a lot of snow on the sidewalks still. I felt somewhat tenuous when I was on sidewalks, since I couldn't see where the ice was. Because of that, I spent more time on the roads than I normally would.

Diet: Normal

Training For: No real reason. Staying in shape.
