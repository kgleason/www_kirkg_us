##Terrain##
A few hills. Mostly pretty flat.

##How I felt##
Considering this is the first time I've ever run more than 3 miles, I think it went pretty well. The 4th interval was the hardest.

##Effort##
It didn't feel too bad, but Fitbit had a pretty high heartrate through most of the run: 30 peak minutes.

##Notes##
Got chased by a dog, which has never happened to me in town. It made me pick up the pace a bit, and I thought it was going to cause me to run out of steam, but I managed to finish.
